\chapter{Model Description}

\section{Why we chose the simulation based approach}

As explained in Chapter 2.4, different methods to evaluate darknet systems exist, each suitable for different usecases. To analyse a routing algorythm, its performance, strengths, and weaknesses, larger scale networks are neccessary. For this, especially while dealing with changeing algorythms and parameters, the simulation approch is most appropriate.
