\section{Why we chose the simulation based approach}

As explained in Chapter 2.4, different methods to evaluate darknet systems exist, each suitable for different use-cases. To analyze a routing algorithm, its performance, strengths, and weaknesses, larger scale networks are necessary. For this, especially while dealing with changing algorithms and parameters, the simulation approach is most appropriate since it has the best trade off of flexibility and scalability
