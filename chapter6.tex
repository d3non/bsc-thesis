\begin{itemize}
\item Everything is epic, but.. ;)

	\item real path length; relevant if protocol tries to take it into account but difficult in a darknet environment
\end{itemize}
\item Implement tested darknets and compare to their tests
\item Implement untested/new nets and improve routing parameters
\begin{itemize} \item        or even decide if algorythm is pratical usefull or not \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
