\section{The simulation library and framework OMNeT++}

As statet above, network simulation is an both effective and efficient method to evaluate network performance, but an underrepresented one for darknets. This section will cover the used simulation framework OMNeT++.

\subsection{Network simulators and why we cose OMNeT++}

In chapter 2.5 we stated that the benefit in using simulation for routing evaluation is the reduced time and memory usage compared to emulation or a testbed. This would comes in exchange for a huge implementation effort, since a simulator, the client model and a network is needed. Fortunately simulatiors and frameworks exist already.

Besides some general purpose simulatiors and many specialized ones, there are even some for network analysation and evaluation. Widely used open source products are ns2/ns3 and OMNeT++. Additionally to saving the implementation of a simulator, using a commonly adopted framework gains a better comparability and to other results and respectability of the results by other researchers.

We chose OMNeT++ for its extendability, modular design and wide varity of already implemented telecomunication protocols shipped with the INET package for example.

\subsection{What is OMNeT++}

OMNeT++ is an simulation library and framework written in C++. It is modular and extensible and primarily used to simulate networks not only limited to telecomunication networks. The simulation

\section{Churn based lifetime model}
If a node goes offline it has to be detected by its peers. Therefor, an acknowledge mechanism is needed. Basically a acknowledge message (short: ACK) is send back on receieving a message. If such an ACK is not received within a certain amount of time, the message can be resent up to a selectable number of times. If no ACK is received after that, the peer is no longer considered the be online and connected.
