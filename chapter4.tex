OMNeT++ is an simulation library and framework written in C++. It is modular and extensible and primarily used to simulate networks not only limited to telecomunication networks. The simulation

\section{Churn based lifetime model}
If a node goes offline it has to be detected by its peers. Therefor, an acknowledge mechanism is needed. Basically a acknowledge message (short: ACK) is send back on receieving a message. If such an ACK is not received within a certain amount of time, the message can be resent up to a selectable number of times. If no ACK is received after that, the peer is no longer considered the be online and connected.
